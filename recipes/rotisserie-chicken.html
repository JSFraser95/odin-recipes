  <h3>Better than Costco!</h3>
  <p>Okay, not really, but this is some good tasting chicken. It's perfect as the main dish of a simple meal with French fries and cole slaw.</p>

  <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken</li>
    <li>1 pinch salt</li>
    <li>¼ cup butter, melted</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
    <li>¼ tablespoon ground black pepper</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Steps:</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Season the inside of the chicken with a pinch of salt. Place the chicken onto a rotisserie and set the grill on high. Cook for 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>During that time, quickly mix together the butter, 1 tablespoon of salt, paprika and pepper. Turn the grill down to medium and baste the chicken with the butter mixture. Close the lid and cook for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, basting occasionally, until the internal temperature reaches 180 degrees F (83 degrees C) when taken in the thigh with a meat thermometer.</li>
    <li>Remove from the rotisserie and let stand for 10 to 15 minutes before cutting into pieces and serving.</li>
  </ol>
